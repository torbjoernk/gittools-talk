Title: Git-based tools to ease your life

Git is a well-known and popular distributed source code management system with strong focus on speed and compatability.
It has an ever growing community of pationate users contributing innovative ways of utilization.

This talk introduces a set of tools to easy every-day workflows (mainly on Unix machines).
For example, maintaining a unified work and development environment on multiple machines can be troublesome.
Managing your Shell, vim/Emacs and other configuration files in Git repositories can save you a lot of time and typing.
It can also be very useful to diff and synchronize system configuration files between multiple remote machines.
Fully encrypted Git repositories even enable tracking of sensitive data.

While managing a diverse set of mostly binary data (videos, images, music, etc.) in different places, it soon becomes hard to keep them safe and sound.
How about a space-efficient local and remote incremental backup system, which is easy to setup and manage?

Tools covered in this talk: etckepper, vcsh, mr, git-annex, bup, git-remote-gcrypt.

A basic knowledge of Git is recommended but not required for this talk.
