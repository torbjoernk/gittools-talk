Title: Git-based tools to ease your life

Git is a well-known and popular distributed source code management system with strong focus on speed and compatability.
It has an ever growing community of pationate users contributing innovative ways of utilization.

This talk introduces a set of tools to easy every-day workflows (mainly on Unix machines).

Having an account on more than one machine can be troublesome in unifying the work and development environment.
Managing your Shell, vim/Emacs and other configuration files in Git repositories can save you a lot of time and typing.
Same holds true for system administrators.
Sometimes it is handy to diff and synchronize system configuration files between multiple remote machines.

While managing a diverse set of mostly binary data (videos, images, music, ...) in different places it becomes hard to keep them organized soon.
What about a space-efficient local and remote incremental backup system, which is easy to setup and to manage?

Finally, in times too many entities want to read your data, fully encrypted Git repositories are a nice bonus.

Tools covered in this talk: etckepper, vcsh, mr, git-annex, bup, git-remote-gcrypt.
A basic knowledge of Git is recommended but not required for this talk.
